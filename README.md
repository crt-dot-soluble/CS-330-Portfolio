# Project Reflection
## Approaching Software Design
My approach to designing this 3D graphics application was fundamentally shaped by the need to create a modular, maintainable system that could handle complex scene rendering. Working on this project helped me develop several key design skills:

- Breaking down complex visual scenes into basic geometric primitives
- Planning material and texture systems that can be reused across multiple objects
- Designing intuitive camera controls that work seamlessly with scene navigation
- The design process followed an iterative path, starting with basic mesh rendering and gradually adding layers of complexity like texturing, lighting, and materials. This taught me the value of building foundational systems first before adding more sophisticated features.

These design tactics - particularly the focus on modularity and incremental complexity - will be valuable in future projects. The ability to break down complex visual requirements into manageable components is a transferable skill across many types of software development.

Program Development Approach
While developing this 3D scene, I implemented several new strategies:

- Using code from separate manager classes (SceneManager, ShaderManager) to organize different aspects of the program
- Implementing reusable transformation functions that could be applied to any object
- Creating a flexible material system that could be easily extended
- Iteration played a crucial role in development. Each milestone built upon previous work:

Basic mesh rendering
Adding textures and materials
Implementing lighting systems
Refining camera controls
Optimizing and polishing the final scene
My development approach evolved from writing monolithic rendering code to creating more modular, reusable systems. This evolution resulted in cleaner, more maintainable code that could be easily modified or extended.

Impact on Future Goals
This project has equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills in computational graphics that will benefit my future education and career:

Educational Applications
Deep understanding of 3D mathematics and transformation matrices
Experience with shader programming and graphics pipelines
Knowledge of optimization techniques for real-time rendering
Professional Applications
Skills in creating modular, reusable graphics code
Experience with industry-standard graphics programming patterns
Understanding of user interface design for 3D applications
The computational graphics skills gained from this project are directly applicable to various fields:

Game development
Scientific visualization
Virtual reality applications
CAD/CAM software development
Simulation systems
Most importantly, this project has demonstrated how complex visual problems can be solved through systematic programming approaches. The combination of mathematical understanding, programming skills, and visual design considerations provides a strong foundation for future work in both educational and professional contexts.

The experience of building a complete 3D graphics application from the ground up has given me confidence in tackling complex software projects and a deeper appreciation for the role of computer science in creating immersive visual experiences.

These skills and knowledge will be valuable assets as I continue my education and move into professional software development, particularly in fields requiring 3D visualization or real-time graphics programming.
